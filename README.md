# MLAPI

Day 1

Created project in 2020.3.12f1 - universal renderer. Deleted superflous scene objects.

Put scene in MLAPI github folder and made sure it uploaded to github correctly

Turned on preview packages in package manager advanced settings.

Installed probuilder package for ease in creating a simple scene. Created simple scene with probuilder. Ground, table and ball.

Added XRRig

Added Physics Material to ball in scene.


Day 2

Added hand presence and hand animator to show grab and pinch motions.

Added Continuous movement, character controller and snap turn to XR Rig.

Continuous movement script allows player to move with left stick.

Created grabbable objects layer and body layer so the grabbed object doesn't push the player around when its being held.

Made left and right hand direct interactors seperate from ray interactor.

Ray interactor only shows when it hovers over an object.
